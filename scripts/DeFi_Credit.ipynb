    "\n",
    "DeFi credit risk is governed by a solvency ratio called the **Health Factor** ($HF$). Liquidation eligibility is determined mechanically when $HF$ falls below 1, so $HF$ is the foundation for continuous monitoring and control triggers.\n",

    "TWAP reduces sensitivity to brief price spikes (harder to manipulate), but it can lag during fast market moves. Since $HF_k(t)$ is computed from $P_c(t)$ and $P_d(t)$, oracle design directly affects liquidation timing and clustering.\n",

    "Think of the protocol as running a continuous “can this borrower be safely kept open?” check:\n",

    "Each line shows what happens if we *sell* a given amount of ETH ($\\Delta x$) into an ETH/USDC constant-product AMM. The script reports (i) how many USDC the trade returns ($\\Delta y$), (ii) the pool’s quoted mid price before the trade ($p_{\\text{mid before}}=y/x$), (iii) the realized average execution price $p_{\\text{avg}}=\\Delta y/\\Delta x$, and (iv) the pool’s quoted mid price after the trade ($p_{\\text{mid after}}=y'/x'$). As the sell size grows from 10 ETH to 2,500 ETH, the realized average price falls from ~2,490 to ~1,995 USDC/ETH while the post-trade quoted price falls even further (to ~1,602). This is **slippage/price impact**: large forced liquidation trades move the AMM price against the seller, reducing realized proceeds and increasing the chance of a liquidation shortfall relative to oracle marks.\n"

    "The above table compares **scenario-level risk statistics** for the same portfolio under two simulated market regimes: **Base** (normal conditions) and **Stress** (higher volatility / jump risk). Each row is computed across the full Monte Carlo set and summarizes either (i) how often liquidations occur and how severe they are in the tail, (ii) whether liquidations create residual losses (“shortfall”), and (iii) how bad execution becomes due to AMM slippage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mean_liq_rate` is the average fraction of accounts that become liquidatable ($HF<1$) across scenarios (about **0.86%** in Base vs **3.72%** in Stress).\n",
    "- `p95_liq_rate` and `p99_liq_rate` are “bad day” liquidation fractions at the 95th and 99th percentiles (about **5.67% / 12.33%** in Base vs **20.67% / 34.67%** in Stress), showing liquidations become much more clustered under stress.\n",
    "- `P(shortfall>0)` is 0 in both regimes, meaning the model does not generate residual loss dollars under the current assumptions; however, the tail (`p95_liq_rate`, `p99_liq_rate`, `p95_exec_slippage`) still shows materially higher liquidation rates and worse execution slippage under Stress scenario, indicating elevated operational and liquidity stress even without modeled shortfall.\n",
    "- `VaR95_shortfall`, `ES95_shortfall`, `VaR99_shortfall`, `ES99_shortfall` report tail loss measures for shortfall; they are **0** because shortfall never occurs in these runs.\n",
    "- `p95_exec_slippage` is the 95th-percentile execution slippage proxy; it rises from about **1.33%** (Base) to **3.87%** (Stress), consistent with larger liquidation volumes pushing AMM execution prices against the seller.\n",
